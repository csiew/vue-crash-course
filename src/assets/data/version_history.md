## React era

### Version 3.0 (19/06/2021 - Present)
Another overhaul of the website, but using React this time. I wanted to practice using functional components rather than class components, and to take advantage of React Hooks. The CSS from the previous site was getting huge and unwieldy too, so it's high-time to simplify it.

## Vue era

### Version 2.0 (24/09/2020 - 19/06/2021)
A complete overhaul of the website as a playground to learn Vue. Like version 1.0, this iteration of the site went through drastical design changes throughout its lifetime. The CSS stylesheets I developed for this site largely came from my abandoned podcast app project.

## Pre-framework era

### Version 1.1 (2020 - 24/09/2020)
Stripped back to just a single landing page. It had nothing more than links to my social media accounts and side projects. [Click here to visit this version of the site.](https://csiew.github.io/index.html)

### Version 1.0 (2018 - 2020)
Initial implementation using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Early revisions were not single-page apps, and often swung wildly between brutalist web design and skeumorphic design. The final revision of version 1.0 used JavaScript to inject templated components like the navigation bar and site footer (which is the _opposite_ of what most modern JavaScript SPA frameworks do). This project used my now-abandoned frontend library, _Cardo_, to perform these injections. [Click here to visit this version of the site.](https://csiew.github.io/archive/index.html)
