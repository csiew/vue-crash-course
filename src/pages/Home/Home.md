Hi there!

I'm Clarence. I'm a software engineer based in Melbourne, Australia, though I originally hail from sunny Penang, Malaysia.

Prior to programming professionally, programming has been a hobby of mine since I was at least 10 years old. I started with developing batch scripts in Windows XP, developed a Linux distribution (more like a remaster) with custom Python scripts, and now mostly work on web applications and microservices.
