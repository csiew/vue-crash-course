> This post was meant to be a small musing on my new `/now` page. But I just kept writing, and writing, and writing as more thoughts poured out of my head.

### A mammoth-shaped realisation

At the time of Elon Musk's Twitter acquisition from hell, [I made a Mastodon account](https://mastodon.online/@csiew) out of curiosity to see what the whole Fediverse craze was about. Honestly, what I ended up loving about the experience had nothing to do with the Fediverse, as in the _way_ it works. It was the fact that:

- A lot of my favourite people in/around/hovering/observing/reporting-on tech migrated there from Twitter.
- I found a couple of fellow South East Asian people (specifically Malaysian and Singaporean) there who've been posting about my own culture (or at least neighbouring cultures with some common links). I'm guilty of not really broadcasting/promoting my own culture, honestly speaking. It was fun to even [learn some things about Hokkien](https://mastodon.online/@liztai@hachyderm.io/110014679915052545) (the language or Chinese dialect, it's highly debatable what it is, that the maternal side of my family speaks), and to even interact with the stranger that posted it (something I would never have done on Twitter)!
- TikTok/Reels-style trends aren't really a thing here. I don't feel like I'm being left out of _yet another thing_ which I don't _actually_ care about. Though, people posting about travel seems to be unavoidable regardless of what platform you're on. (I'm not the biggest fan of travelling.)
- Hot takes aren't as common as on Twitter, so flame wars where people throw surface-level facts, half-truths, and half-baked opinions aren't polluting my feed.

### Putting it out there

It kind of sucks that not many people in my personal circle (family, friends, acquaintances) aren't on it. A lot of them are on Instagram where they've been dutifully keeping their stories fresh and new posts hot off their Camera Roll, but that just isn't for me (aside from being a nosy observer).

On the other hand I'm a little anxious about sharing content to my personal circle. I guess there's a touch of sadness when I learn that not many people I know are that interested in what I'm up to. But let's be real, they have the right to not care - all of us have wildly varying interests and no one could honestly care to pull off constantly throwing a variation of a _"this is so cool"_ comment at someone's updates on their hobby or interest that isn't _their_ cup of tea.

It just hurts more when someone makes that lack of interest explicit. Back when I was developing my Linux distribution, [illume OS](/projects/illume-os), and actively sharing updates on my personal Facebook, an ex-schoolmate coldly posted _"No one fucking cares"_.

### Dopamine

Who am I kidding? Sometimes getting those likes and [_seal claps of approval_](https://giphy.com/gifs/disney-ocean-clapping-hDwYu8UEcUone) kind-of-comments give a bit of a dopamine rush. **But**, I don't _want_ to conform to the masses. I don't _want_ to get into the latest trends or fads. I don't _want_ to do shit that would make me popular but that I would absolutely hate doing.

I've heard a story of someone I knew who seemed like they had a bright future ahead of them. They were kind, made something of an effort to connect with everyone (though sometimes only at a surface level, and sometimes it came off as somewhat patronising), and new exactly what their plans in life were. They're (currently) posting plenty about their adventures, hanging out with friends, and just generally having an absolute blast. They're getting plenty of social media reactions, but they've been feeling miserable and left-behind when it comes to their studies, career, and general progress in life.

> Just to assure the people I personally know, this is not a family member, a friend, a former friend or foe, colleague, or former colleague. What this person is experiencing is truly horrible, and I only wish the best for them. I was merely using their experience as an example. I will never reveal their identity.

### What really matters

What I'm really getting at is that sometimes the people we _really_ want to share our interests or finds with don't actually care. And it hurts to find out they don't give a shit. **And that's OK.** It's not their fault, and neither is it yours.

Social media, dating apps, and the like have made everything a numbers game. They've made getting any kind of symbolic approval that bumps some counter up a huge achievement, like you're in sales and each _like_ is equivalent to a multi-million dollar deal.

Circling back to Mastodon, I don't have many followers nor do I even post anything. But the fact that I _know_ that I could learn a thing or two and even feel encouraged to interact with people without having that _like_ count dangling over my head is a fucking nice icy-cold blast of fresh air. On Mastodon, it doesn't mean jack shit if one or a million people _liked_ your post or reply.

The quantity of social media interactions shouldn't mean a thing. Rather, the fact that you could connect with interesting people, even if for a fleeting moment or maybe not at all, and learn something new, interesting, or cool **_to you_** is what should really matter in the end.
