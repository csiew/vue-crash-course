An extension for Google Chrome to let you view and manage your tabs from the side panel. It provides easy access to various controls to sleep tabs, regroup/ungroup tabs, and close them. It was designed to look as close as possible as to what a native implementation of vertical tabs in Chrome would look like (with some creative liberties for the sake of usability).
