I'm a full-stack software engineer based in Melbourne. I love reading about history, listening to rock music (I curate annual zeitgeist [playlists](/playlists)) and the occassional writing of lore for fictional game worlds.

Coding isn't just a job for me, it's been a passion of mine since I was 9 years old. Check out a selection of my [personal projects](/projects).

I mostly develop in TypeScript and JavaScript for both backend services and frontend/websites. I've used a plethora frontend frameworks/libraries such as React, Next.js, Vue.js, Svelte/SvelteKit, and Mithril.js for work and personal projects.

I have experience developing in Java and Kotlin for backend services. I also use Shell and Python scripts from time to time for some DevOps or quick data processing.

I also actively use Amazon Web Services at work. For personal projects I largely use Netlify for CI/CD and hosting, with some experimenting with edge functions; Google Firebase for its cloud database and cloud functions.
