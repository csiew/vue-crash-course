### "Oh, I'm working on a side project", I exclaim for the millionth time.

For the last five-or-so years I've been telling people I've been working on some side projects. Well, it's literally been one(-ish) project this entire time. For five years.

Honestly I conceptualised a very, very vague version of what I'm working on now back during my internship at National Australia Bank in 2018. It's an idea that's evolved through the years:

- The user experience has shifted dramatically over time.
- It has been partially implemented, scrapped, and re-implemented at least 2-3 times now.
- It has grown from a one-purpose SaaS into a full-blown workspace-like experience, and back into a one-purpose thing.

As of March 2023 I honestly thing it's finally going somewhere - there's finally a cohesive vision _and_ purpose. I was a little _too_ picky about getting _everything_ perfect from the beginning, but now I think it's only possible to make the right decisions by giving them a go first.

And no, I will not be broadcasting what this project is just yet!
