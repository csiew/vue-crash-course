Spotify has somewhat broken my ability to have a _favourite_ artist. I used to have phases where one or two particular bands or singers I really enjoyed listening to on repeat defined my music tastes.

Prior to embracing music streaming (and curated recommendations) as my default way of listening to music, I had my Beatles, Coldplay, Radiohead, and The National eras. And by eras, I mean I only ever wanted to listen to music of the _exact_ same style. That usually just meant sticking to listening to that same artist's entire discography front-to-back, back-to-front.

> Fun fact: back in high school I was in band club - my first band **_hated_** me because they were in **_their_** Linkin Park and Green Day phase while I was still in my Beatles phase; my second band got sick of my growing fascination with Radiohead's Kid A.

These days, I may listen to a lot of a handful of artists at any given time. It's no longer the case that they would define the entirety of what I'm listening to at the time. I'm absolutely loving the transcendant stoner rock of [_Queens of_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DGzijoY-us) [_the Stone Age_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oz3BLU3O3Y); but I'm also really leaning into [_Do Nothing_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4bYwFUfJmE) who have this unexplainable subtle unorthodoxy to their lyrics and musical arrangements.
