### Links page?

I feel compelled to implement a link sharing page on my website, for me. I've been finding a lot of interesting articles about tech, productivity, anthropology, science, history, and music that I've been wanting to share.

I just want a space devoid of feeling antsy about likes or view counts. I just want to dump some links out there to share without polluting social media timelines or private group chats.
