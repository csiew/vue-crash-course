> This was meant to come out on Wednesday, 12 April. But work was unexpectedly chaotic, so I wasn't able to push this out until the 13th!

I'm thinking of doing a once-a-week series of interesting things I found on the internet. Since it's a Wednesday, let's call this series the Hump Day Curiosity Dump!

Today's videos are all engineering related:
- Tom Scott takes a look at a one-man hovercraft project.
- NASA is finally going to build nuclear-powered rocket engines!
- A look to the past in early UI/UX in the Apple Lisa.
