A podcast web app that allows you to manage your podcast subscriptions and bookmarks with an intuitive, well-organised interface.

It used the Node.js runtime with the Express framework for its backend API service.

The initial version of Cast used my own custom frontend library, Cardo. However I later switched to the Vue.js framework.

This project came very close to a public release just before I got my first full-time job. I am considering the possibility of rebuilding this (with drastically better architectural decisions).
