A Debian-based Linux distribution designed for a simple out of the box experience. Ideal for Windows users transitioning to Linux. It used the Xfce desktop environment.

A variant based on Ubuntu with Flatpak integration was in the works shortly before its abandonment. I also considered reviving Antorca Linux with my custom window manager, [BiscuitWM](/projects/biscuitwm), at one point.
